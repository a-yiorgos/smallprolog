Changes in December 1991.

A makefile for GCC-386 has been added, as well as the executable
and the DOS-extender.

The Turbo C makefile is now for a large model program.

The file prmanual.txt has been slightly updated.

prgccpc.c has been added for the GCC version.

Prolog.h has been extended for the GCC version.

The files spread across 2 floppy disks.


prlush.c has been modified so that tracing is more powerful
-you can "skip" or step over the details of a call.
-you can force a backtrack.
-you can trace backwards, providing no side effects 
  (with assertz's for example) were done.
-you can unleash tracing

dump_stack has been renamed dump_ancestors in prlush.c, pralloc.c and
prdebug.c

Builtins can now backtrack by returning ND_SUCCESS (see prtypes.h) 
and the new builtin (repeat) does just this.
prlush.h prlush.c, prtypes.h have been extended to this effect.
(gennum X 3) backtracks X through integers between 0 and 3 inclusive.
